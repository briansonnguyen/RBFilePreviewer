#RBFilePreviewer

##WARNING:
`RBFilePreviewer` does not work on iOS 6. `QLPreviewController` has been changed to use XPC. This prevents any customization, and I have not found any work arounds.

##Summary
`RBFilePreviewer` is a subclass of `QLPreviewController`. It is intended to make it easy to preview any `QLPreviewItem`. All you need to do is pass it the desired item(s) to preview to the appropriate initializer. You may use the provided `RBFile` class or any other class that conforms to `QLPreviewItem` (including `NSURL`).

##Dependencies
`RBFile` requires my `NSURL+RBExtras` category. It can be found in my [RBCategories repository][1]. `RBFile` is optional, so if you don't include it, then you don't need to include `NSURL+RBExtras`.

##Acknowledgments
`RBFilePreviewer` includes a couple icons from Joseph Wain. See Glyphish.com for more details. To get the 2x sizes of the icons, you must buy the Glyphish Pro icon pack.
